In this project, we are going to design a mechanical sorting system. The sorting system
is expected to detect and classify four different kinds of materials by sensors and
actuators. Those four materials include Aluminum, Steel, Black plastic and White
plastic. To make the sorting system work properly, it is required the knowledge of circuit
wiring, the functions of ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), different kinds of interrupts
(rising edge and falling edge), PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), stepper motor, and DC
motor. Furthermore, an embedded programming technique is required, including
consideration of stepper motor hissing effects and sensor debouncing.
